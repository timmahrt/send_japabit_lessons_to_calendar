# Send JapaTalk Lessons to Google Calendar

This is a Chrome Extension--my first Chrome Extension.

https://www.japatalk.com/ is a website for Japanese learners to take online lessons with teachers.  It has its own calendar system.  This extension will copy scheduled lessons from the calendar page into the learner's Google Calendar.

To make this I started with the Google Extensions tutorial:
